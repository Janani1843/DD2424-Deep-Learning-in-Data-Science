# DD2424-Deep-Learning-in-Data-Science

Assignment 1 - In this assignment a one layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset will be trained and tested. The network will be trained using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.

Assignment 2 - Similar to assignment 1 but a 2-layer network with cyclic learning rates

Assignment 3 -In this assignment k-layer networks with multiple outputs to classify images (once again) from the CIFAR-10 dataset will be trained and tested. The code from Assignment 2 will be upgraded in two significant ways:
  1. Generalizing the code so that k-layer networks can be trained and tested.
  2. Incorporate batch normalization into the k-layer network both for training and testing.
